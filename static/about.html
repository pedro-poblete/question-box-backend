      <p>Puberty often comes with questions about oneâ€™s own body, feelings or relationships. <em>Those Questions</em> is a platform where teenagers from all countries and cultures can submit questions about puberty, relationships, sexuality and sex. The questions are then answered by young people from different cultures who have often had similar experiences when they had to settle in Germany.</p>
      <p>The project is led by a young international team who have all been working in culturally sensitive education for a long time and includes people coming from Germany, Chile, India, and Belgium.</p>
      <p>Funding comes from the <a href='https://prototypefund.de' target='_blank'>Prototype Fund</a>, which connects iterative software development to government funding.</p>
